# The demo of using Custom Speech Service with Microsoft Translator to improve translation result

## Background
The Speech Translator Services can easily help to translate speech from one language to other languages. However, in some real scenarios of vertical industries, especially manufacturing industry, many domain specific vocabularies and abbreviations are often used with complex acoustic conditions. In these situations, general speech recognition and speech translator services arenâ€™t able to meet the requirement of accuracy. Some specific vocabularies may be wrongly recognized and translated to other meanings. 

In this demo, we'll use Windows UWP App to show how we can use Custom Speech Model and Microsoft Translator to improve the Speech translation result for specific vocabularies and acoustic conditions. there are 4 objectives for this demo app: 

1. Help to quickly test your Custom Speech model
2. Help to understand how to use Custom Speech model with REST API and SDK
3. Compare the recognition result of regular speech model with your Custom Speech Model
4. Show how translation result can be improved by using Custom Speech Service with Microsoft Translator. 

## Prerequisites
* A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the speech service for free](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started).
* A Windows PC with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (10.0; Build 16299) or later.

* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/), Community Edition or higher.
* The **Universal Windows Platform development** workload in Visual Studio.
* Note: processor target ARM is not yet supported.
* Please build and deploy your Custom Speech Model via <a href="https://cris.ai" target="_blank"> Custom Speech Service Portal</a>
* If you don't have your Custom Speech Model, please refer to https://github.com/leonlj/CustomSpeechExample to build the model.
* Please make sure you have Microsoft Translator Text Service in Azure. If you haven't had, please refer to <a href=https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/translator-text-api/ target="_blank"> Translator Text Link </a>
